# search in laravel using htmx

### Overview 

As a backend developer , sometimes i think is there a way to do things dynamically (without page reload), instead of using Ajax?
> does this question also arose in you're mind ?

If yes, then that's the motivation to start with this project which uses [Htmx](https://htmx.org/) to work with HTTPS requests and handle related operations easily.

[This](https://github.com/JaiveerChavda/search-with-htmx/tree/search-with-htmx) is a simple repository showing a search functionality which show the result dynamically without page reload.

 I used htmx because , sometimes it's tricky to use ajax for such a simple search functionality , also it's so much time consuming.
